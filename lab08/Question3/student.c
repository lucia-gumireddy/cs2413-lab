/*
Question 3: Is Subsequence

Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t,
or false otherwise.

A subsequence of a string is a new string formed from the original
string by deleting some characters without changing the order of
the remaining characters.

Example 1:
Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: false

Hint:
- This can be solved using two pointers.

bool isSubsequence(char* s, char* t) {
    int i = 0; // pointer for s
    int j = 0; // pointer for t

    while (t[j] != '\0') {
        if (s[i] == t[j]) {
            i++;
        }
        j++;
    }

    // If we reached end of s, it's a subsequence
    return s[i] == '\0';
